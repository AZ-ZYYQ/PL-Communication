##### Overview
The core of declaring a variable
Declaration creates a variable of a particular type, attaches a name to it, and maybe set its initial value.

Why Must Variables Be Declared?
In some language, you can create a new variable whenever you use a new name without declaration, such as BASIC. However, when organizing your program, you cannot avoid making some basic mistakes, such as "misspell" and so on. In that way, it is hard for you to identify the program error caused by the wrong use of a variable. And without declaration mechanism, any misspelling can be seen as normal due to the design. 
So, In C/C++, Declaration is necessary before using.

变量声明
所有的编程语言都会在定义一个变量之前声明需要使用的数据类型。在C语言中，声明一个变量时，数据类型除了有说明变量存储空间大小的作用外，还可以告诉编译器，我正在声明一个变量。然而在一些具有类型推导的编程语言中，数据类型可有可无，编译器少去了一个变量标识方式 ，编译器就无法确定某个字段的具体含义，因此，在具有类型推导功能的编程语言中，都会统一使用一个或两个关键字，来声明一个变量(标记).

The consideration in determining the default value of a new variable
There are three kinds of behaviors when referring to the default value of a new variable：
- No default value is specified, and the variable can be used directly even without an initial value, such as C. -> The language designer think that the developers should have the freedom and ability to control all the variables in a program.
- The default value are specified, such as Java.
- The default vaue isn't specified, but the variable must hold a value before the first time being used, such as Cangjie.

The default type of an literal value


How can I organize this note?
Variables are needed in all kinds of programming language, The purpose of this note is to make a full overview of the way creating a variable in different languages. There are three points of this part.
1. The Basic rule of declaring a variable
2. The visiablity of the variable
3. Default Value or Default Typ
4. Other Tips

##### C/C++
To store an item of information in a computer, you must identify both the ==storage location== and how much ==memory space== the information requires. In C++, it uses a ==declaration statement== to indicate the type of storage and to provide a label for the location.
```c
/* 
 * 格式
 * 数据类型 变量名;
 * 数据类型 变量名 = 值;
 */
char h;  //直接定义
int i, j, k; //连续定义
int i = 4; //初始化，定义变量的同时进行赋值
int i, j = 4, k; //结合使用
```
1. 连续定义和初始化可以结合使用，如`int i, j=2, h;`，但是不建议用这种方式，容易搞混；
2. In C and Pascal, all variable declarations normally come at the very beginning of a function or procedure. But C++ has no such restriction. Indeed, the usual C++ style is to declare a variable just before it is first used. (Incidentally, C99 now makes the rules for C declarations much the same as for C++)
3. 在C语言中，同一个作用域内不能声明两个同名的变量，不同作用域内，变量的使用参考就近原则。内层作用域内的变量对外层同名变量具有掩盖作用。而在Rust中，可以在同一个作用域内声明两个同名变量，后者的定义会掩盖前者。---这属于不同的编程语言实现
4. 在C语言中，声明变量的本质是为一定大小的内存空间标记一个变量名，除此之外编译器不会做任何事情。因此变量的默认值是垃圾值。

##### Rust
1. The Basic rule of declaring a variable
在Rust中，使用`let`关键字声明一个变量，变量默认是不可变的(immutable)，若要创建一个可变变量，需要使用`mut`关键字。
```Rust
let mut guess = String::new();  //声明一个可变变量
guess = 20;
let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101); //声明一个不可变变量
```

2. The visiablity of the variable
Rust中可以使用相同的名字声明新的变量，新的变量就会Shadow(隐藏)之前声明的同名变量，通常用于类型转换中。
```Rust
fn main() {
	let x = 5;
	let x = x + 1;   //变量名可以重复，新声明的x会隐藏原有的x
	//在后续的代码中，变量名x代表的就是新的变量

	let spaces = "   ";  //&str类型，暂时可以理解为字符串类型
	let spaces = spaces.len();   //usize类型，和计算机架构有关
	//新声明的同名变量，类型可以与之前不同
	
	println!("The value of x is {}", x); //打印x的值为6
}
```
- In effect, the second variable overshadows the first, taking any uses of the variable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends.
- 如果不使用`let`关键字，那么重新给非mut的变量赋值会导致编译时错误
- 使用`let`声明的同名新变量，默认也是不可变的，使用`let`声明的同名新变量，它的类型可以与之前不同
- [x] 可以使用`mut`关键字声明新的同名新变量吗？ ✅ 2024-12-03 -> No problem

3. Default Type and Initialization Value
```Rust
//Initialization value
//Declaration frist and then assign a type corresponding value.
let A: u32;
A = 10;
//A = 223;   error assignment.
//Or initialize them in declaration
let B = 10;
```
- The variables only can be used after initialization. For immutable variables, you can initialize them in declaration statement. Or you can only declare them first and then assign a value to them.
- For method one, the program will encounter an errror if you assign the value to the immutable variable twice.
```Rust
//Type-Auto-Inference ---- Defalut Type
fn main() {
	let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101); 
	//secret_number 为i32类型

	let x = 2.0;  //x是f64类型
	let x: f32 = 2.0; //新声明的x变量属于f32类型
}
```
Rust默认将整型识别为`i32`类型，将浮点数识别为`f64`类型

##### Go
All the questions are verified in code:  
1. The rule of declaring a variable
There are two kinds of methods in declaring a variable
-> Method one: two keywords `var` and `const` are used to declared a variable or constant in Go program.
```go
//var name type = expression
var A int = 10    //the full format
var B = 20        //omit the `type` part
var C int         //omit the `= expression` part
```
- Either the type or the ` = expression` part can be omitted, but not both.
	-> If the ` = expression` part is omitted, the complier will assign a default `zero` value according to its type, which is 0 for numbers, false for booleans, "" for strings, nil for interfaces and reference types.
	The zero value of an aggregate type like an array or a struct has the zero of all of its elements of fields.
	-> If the `type` part is omitted, the complier will infer its type automatically according to the value assigned.
- With a matching list of expressions, it is possible to declare and optionally initialize a set of variable in a single declaration.
```go
//It is a bit different from the rule in C/C++.
var i, j, k int    //all the variables' type are int: int int int
var b, f, s = true, 2.3, "four"  //bool, float64, string
```
- [x] What it would be if the value list is match the variable list. -> An error would occur 
- [x] Can I specify different types for a set of variable in one declaration statement without using  ` = expression ...`.   -> No, an error occurs.
- Initializers may be literal values or arbitrary expressions.
- A set of variables can also be initialized by calling a function that returns multiple values:
```go
var f, err = os.Open(name)    //os.Open returns a file and an error
```
- An alternate method for declaring a set of pacakge-level variable.
```go
var (
	A = 10
	B = "Tom"
)
```

-> Method two: Within a function, an alternate form called ==short variable declaration== maybe used to declare and initialize local variables.
```go
func Test() int {
	//name := expression
	anim := gif.GIF{LoopCount: nframes}
	freq := rand.Float64() * 3.0
	t := 0.0
}
```
- The type of the local variable is determined by the type of expression.
- As with `var` declarations, multiple variable may be declared and initialized in the same short variable declaration.
```go
i, j := 0, 1
```
-  So the function's return value.
```go
f, err := os.Open(name)
```
- The `:=` can also act as an assignment to those variables already declared in the same lexical block, meanwhile `:=` should be used to declare at least one new variable.
- The declarations in an outer block are ignored.
```go
//The variable is declared via `var` before using :=
var a = 10
for a, b := 20, "hh"; a < 30; a += 10 {  //b is a new variable
	//statements
}

//The variable is already declared via `:=`
var arr []int = {1, 2, 3}
for _, i := range arr { //the declarations are in an outer block??
	//statements
}
```


2. The visiablity of the variable
The package-level variable/constant declaration follows the `import` declarations in Go program and outside of functions. 
The name of each package-level entity is visible not only throughout the source file that contains its declaration, but throughout all the files of the package.

The local variable/constant are declared inside a function or a smaller scope inside it. And they are visible only within the function in which they are declared and perhaps only within a small part of it.

3. Other Tips
- 该区域的数据值可以在同一个类型范围内不断变化
- 变量在同一个作用域内不能重名
- 变量三要素：变量名、值、数据类型
- Golang的变量如果没有赋初值，编译器会使用默认值。

Java声明变量的方式和C/C++相同

##### Cangjie
1. The Basic rule of declaring a variable
In Cangjie, the data type of a variable can be automatically inferred, allowing it to be ommited when creating variables. Thus, using specific keywords is necessary for variable creation.
Cangjie provides two types of basic variables: mutable and immutable. The keyword `let` is used to create an immutable variables, which is equivalent to a constant in Cangjie, while the keyword `var` is used for mutable variables.

Cangjie is a Strongly Typed language, which means each variable has a defined data type. Cangjie offers two methods for variable declaration:
- One, explicit declaration, variables are declared by explictly specifing their data type. 
- Two, implicit declaration, variables are declared without directly stating their datatype, the type is infered from the value assigned.
```javascript
//修饰符 变量名: 变量类型 = 初始值
//explicit declaration
let A: Int8 = 10   
//implicit declaration
var B = 30
```

Here are some basic rules when creating a variable in Cangjie:
- In Cangjie, all variables must be assigned a value before they are used which means they must be initialized before hand.
- Global variables and static member variables(defined in a class or struct) must be assigned a value at the time of declaration.
- When declaring a variable without assigning a value, the data type cannot be ommitted.
```Rust
let A: Int8   //Declaring variable without assigning a value, the datatype is needed.
let B         //wrong usage, the datatype cannot be ommitted when declaring a variable without a value.
```
- After finishing to assign a value to a immutable variable, the value cannot be changed anymore.
```Rust
let A: Int8 = 10
A = 20            //Wrong usage, the value of A cannot be changed anymore

let B: Int8
B = 10            //Finish the initialization of the immutable variable B
B = 20            //wrong usage, the value of B cannot be changed anymore.
```
- A variable name must a valid Cangjie identifier, see notes [[Annotation And Code Format]]
- The value assigned to variable can be literal or Cangjie statement which holds a value.

2. Default Value or Default Type
As mentioned above, In Cangjie, the compiler does not specify default values for variable of different types, and it point it out clearly that every variable must hold a value beforehand, meaning programmers are responsible for assigning a value to initialize new variables.
Thanks to the Auto-Infer-Type mechanism, different literal values in Cangjie are recognized as their corresponding default types.

Note: 也就是说没有默认值的说法，变量使用前要么指定初始值，要么完成初始化
